# Multiple-diseases-detection-Web-App
The increasing prevalence of various diseases calls for the development of efficient and accurate disease detection systems. In this study, we propose a systematic approach for multiple diseases detection using machine learning techniques in a web-based application. The proposed system utilizes a dataset of medical data and employs pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification techniques to detect and diagnose diseases. The system's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity which showed promising results. The proposed system offers an accessible and cost-effective solution for disease diagnosis, allowing for early detection and timely treatment. The developed web-based application can be deployed on a cloud platform, enabling easy access and scalability. Overall, the proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve disease detection and diagnosis, thus enhancing healthcare outcomes.
